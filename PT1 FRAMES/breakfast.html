<ol type="1" align="left">
<li><b>INGREDIENTS:</b><br>
	<pre>1 kg. lean beef, sliced thinly
3 -4 tbsp cooking oil
8 cloves garlic, mashed
2 pcs Knorr Beef Cubes
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 -2 tbsp vinegar
Rice
Garlic
Egg
tomatoes
onions
	</pre>
</li>
<h1>STEPS</h1>
<li>Make a marinade for your tapa by combining the oil, garlic, Knorr Beef Cubes, brown sugar and vinegar in a bowl. <br>
Mix this well until the ingredients are dissolved and free of lumps. Gently place the beef slices in and just leave <br>
it in the chiller to marinate overnight.
</li>
<li>The following day, drain the beef and let it dry because you don’t want any of those excess liquid when you fry the tapa.</li>
<li>Fry the tapa in medium high heat with a little bit of oil. And that’s about it! Finally, this dish is done!</li>
<li>Start frying your rice with garlic for around 15 minutes and cook your egg with tomatoes and onions.</li>
<li>With a serving of garlic rice and egg or salted egg mixed with tomatoes and onions, you simply will want to<br>
 have this any day any time of the week. Tapsilog is home!</li>
