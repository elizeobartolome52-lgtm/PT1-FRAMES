<ol type="1" align="left">
<li><b>INGREDIENTS:</b><br>
	<pre>4¼ cups water
2 cups pork spare rib cut into chunks
1 pc red onion, quartered
2 pcs medium sized tomato, quartered
8 pcs sitaw, sliced into 2” pieces
250 g kangkong stalk and leaves
1 pc talong, sliced
2 pcs siling pangsigang
1 (20g) pack Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original
Optional: labanos, okra
	</pre>
</li>
<h1>STEPS</h1>
<li>Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs <br>
submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water. Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to float<br>
 to the surface. Meticulously remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a spatula. <br>
 Scums are impurities found in meat.
</li>
<li>After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it’s time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add<br>
 flavor to the broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat so that<br>
 the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs, You also do this so you can tell if it’s already set and tender.</li>
 
<li>You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook until these<br>
 turn dark green. If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This should take roughly around 2-3 minutes.</li>
 
<li>Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It should be done in about 2-3 minutes.</li>

<li>All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies everyone in the family!<br>
 Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this Filipino classic soup. Enjoy!</li>
