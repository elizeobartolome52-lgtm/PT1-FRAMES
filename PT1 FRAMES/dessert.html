<h1 align="left">CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM</h1>
<ol type="1" align="left">
<li><b>INGREDIENTS:</b><br>
	<pre>3 cups whole milk
2 ounces (about 6 tablespoons) cocoa nibs
1/2 cup sugar
1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) best quality cocoa powder, such as Valrhona or Pernigotti
6 egg yolks
8 ounces best quality dark chocolate, about 70% cocoa solids, such as <br>Valrhona, Madecasse, Cacao Barry, or Callebaut
1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, to taste
	</pre>
</li>
<h1>STEPS</h1>
<li>In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring milk to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Stir in cocoa nibs, cover, and let steep for 2 hours.
</li>
<li>In a clean heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together sugar and cocoa powder until no large lumps of cocoa remain.<br>
 Then whisk in egg yolks until thoroughly combined. (Whisking in a different order will lead to a clumpy mess.)</li>
 
<li>Strain milk into yolk mixture, pressing on cocoa nibs to squeeze out all possible dairy, then whisk dairy to combine.<br>
 Set pan over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until custard reaches 170°F (77°C) on an instant-read thermometer.<br>
 Custard should coat the back of a spoon and a finger swiped across it should leave a clean line.</li>
 
<li>Add chocolate and stir until thoroughly melted. Strain into a container or bowl, add salt, and chill in refrigerator<br>
 or ice bath until base cools to 40°F (4°C). Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions, then serve <br>
 right away as soft serve or transfer to an airtight container to harden in freezer for 3 to 4 hours before scooping.</li>
